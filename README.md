# Reinforcement-Learning


# Jacks car rental problem using Dynamic programing: 
A car inventory management system implemented using reinforcement learning techniques like dynamic programing and markov decision process. The demand and supply variables of the problem are asummed to have a Poison distribution. This code determines the best action (number of cars to move) given a particuar state of the enviornment (number of cars at each location). (This is an excercise from chapter 4 : Dynamic programing of Sutton and barto's book 'Reinforcement Learning: An introduction')

# Tic Tac Toe (Advanced): 
An implementation of Tic Tac Toe game using approximate value functions of reinforcement learning. This is an attempt at getting the agent to learn attack (start first) and defencw (start second) policies using policy gradients and temporal difference 


# Tic Tac Toe (Simplified): 
Same as above. The agent learns only attack policies using policy gradient and Monte Carlo method

# Tic Tac Toe (Position based): 
An implementation of Tic Tac Toe game using on policy Monte Carlo method in reinforcement learning. The agent learns the value of each position on the game board. Eg: Corner positions can lead to a better chance of winning than the center which in turn leads to a better chance of winning than the edges. 

# Next Steps: 
The above exercises aim at gaining acquaintance with reinforcement learning techniques both exact and approximate methods. The learnings of these projects are to be applied to a larger real-time implementations.
