# Description of each project 
# Jacks car rental problem using Dynamic programing: 
A car inventory management system implemented using reinforcement learning techniques like dynamic programing and markoc decision process. The demand and supply varibles of the problem are asummed to have a Poison distribution. This code determines the best action (number of cars to move) given a particuar state of the enviornment (number of cars at each location). (This is an excercise from chapter 4 : Dynamic programing of Sutton and barto's book 'Reinforcement Learning: An introduction')

# Tic Tac Toe (Advanced): 
An implementation of Tic Tac Toe game using approximate value functions of reinforcement learning. This is an attempt at getting the agent to learn attack (start first) and defend (start second) policies. 


# Tic Tac Toe (Simplified): 
Same as above. The agent learns only defence policies.

# Position based Tic Tac Toe: 
An implementation of Tic Tac Toe game using approximate value functions of reinforcement learning. The agent learns the value of each position on the game board. Eg: Corner positions can lead to a better chance of winning than the center which in turn leads to a better chance of winning than the edges. 

# Next Steps: 
The above exercises aim at gaining acquaintance with reinforcement learning techniques both exact and approximate methods. The learnings of these projects are to be applied to a larger real-time implementation like:
- A fully automated supermarket with inventory management, Queue management, price determination for discounts and offers, recommendations, decisions on when to clean or refill shelf etc
